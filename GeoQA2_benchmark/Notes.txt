Notes on Wikification Accuracy Metric:
    
    I opened approximately 200 links in random and I measured how many were correct for each model.

    -REL/WAT: Mostly correct links, the only ones I counted as incorrect were when the model would describe something and not link to it (e.g. Kalithea->Kalithea F.C.)
    -GPT: The gpt models were also very accurate on their predictions but their lower accuracy is due to them returning "No link found" in many cases, however the same
    links that the GPT models say they cannot find are often found on other predictions. This means that maybe asking the model twice will solve the issue.
