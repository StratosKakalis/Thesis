Notes on Wikification Accuracy Metric for the first test between WAT/REL/GPT:
    
    I opened approximately 200 links in random and I measured how many were correct for each model.

    -REL/WAT: Mostly correct links, the only ones I counted as incorrect were when the model would describe something and not link to it (e.g. Kalithea->Kalithea F.C.)
    -GPT: The gpt models were also very accurate on their predictions but their lower accuracy is due to them returning "No link found" in many cases, however the same
    links that the GPT models say they cannot find are often found on other predictions. This means that maybe asking the model twice will solve the issue.


Notes for the dataset creation:
    - Broxtowe doesnt have a direct link but I keep it as it seems correct.
    - I assume George Washington Park refers to Town Square.
    - Adjectives like greek, english etc. count as toponyms (Greece, England etc.)
    - I keep the word "county" next to toponyms as part of the toponym.
    - I also keep the word "district" but this sometimes causes issues in Wikification so maybe remove it to see if it improves performance.
