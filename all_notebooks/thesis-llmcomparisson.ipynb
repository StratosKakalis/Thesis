This makes asking queries even easier than before since there's no need to learn any new syntax or write out complex code snippets by hand anymore!\n","GeoQ has been designed so that anyone who knows basic English should find it very intuitive to use. It uses a wizard-like approach whereby you simply click through different screens until your final query is generated automatically behind-the-scenes! You don't actually see what happens under the hood at all - just like when you're using Google Maps or other similar services today.\n","Here's a screenshot showing some example usage scenarios:\n","As well as being able to generate standard SPARQL queries, we've also added support for generating more advanced Linked Data Fragments (LDFs). LDFs allow us to return results directly back to the client-side browser without having to make additional requests over HTTP. In fact, they work much like AJAX calls do nowadays but instead of returning JSON data structures, they'll return RDF triples encoded according to one of several supported formats such as Turtle, XML/RSS feeds etc...\n","This means that if you were to run a search against the GeoQ service then rather than getting back a list of links pointing to external resources containing answers to your original query, you'd get them right away within the same page itself. No extra round-trips required whatsoever!\n","In addition to supporting both standard SPARQL and LDF output modes, we've also implemented a third mode known as 'JSON-LD'. As its name suggests, this format outputs results in JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON ) form while still adhering to the rules laid down by the W3C regarding Linked Data best practices.\n","So why did we bother adding yet another option?

We call this process Natural Language Generation.\n","Natural Language Generation is not easy! There exist many different approaches to solving this problem but none of them seem to work well enough yet. Therefore, instead of trying to solve this difficult task ourselves, we decided to use another open source project called NLG4J which provides us with some basic functionality out of the box. However, even though NLG4J does provide us with quite useful features such as sentence generation, template-based generation etc., there still remains much room for improvement when generating answers to complex questions like those found in Jeopardy!. As a result, we had to write custom code to generate answers to certain types of questions manually. These include:\n","Generating lists of items using templates provided by NLG4J;\n","Converting numbers written in English format (\"one million\") to Arabic numerals; and,\n","Using regular expressions to extract information from sentences containing dates/times.\n","NLG4J also allows users to define their own grammars for generating specific kinds of content. Our grammar definitions consist mainly of rules for converting data structures returned by the Answerer into human-readable strings. An example rule definition looks like this:\n","<rule name=\"date\" type=\"template\">\n","    <pattern>\n","        <literal>[[DATE]]</literal>\n","            <field ref=\"startDate\"/>\n","                <value/>\n","                    <text/>\n","                        <literal>{{{startDate}}}</literal>\n","                    </text>\n","                </value>\n","            </field>\n","            <field ref=\"endDate\"/>\n","                <value/>\n","                    <text/>\n","                        <literal>{{{endDate}}}</literal>\n","                    </text>\n","                </value>\n","            </field>\n","    </pattern>\n","</rule>\n","This particular rule tells NLG4J how to turn two date fields named startDate and endDate into a single string representation of both dates separated by a hyphen character (-).\n","Finally, once all answers have been successfully generated\n","\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Prompt: Generator is an expert SPARQL query generator.\n","For each question that the user supplies, the generator will convert it into a valid SPARQL query that can be used to answer the question.\n","Human: \"Where is Oxfordshire located?\"\n","Generator: \"SELECT ?WKT WHERE { yago:Oxfordshire geo:hasGeometry ?o. ?o geo:asWKT ?WKT. }\"\n","Human: \"What is Dublin's administrative type?\"\n","Generator: \"select ?e where { yago:Dublin rdf:type ?e }\"\n","Human: \"What population does Icaria have?\"\n","Generator: \"SELECT ?population WHERE{ yago:Icaria  y2geoo:hasGAG_Population ?population . }\"\n","Human: \"Where is Scotland located?\"\n","Generator:\n","Generated text:WKT WHERE { yago:Scotland geo:hasGeometry?o.?o geo:asWKT?WKT.}\"\n","The above examples are just some of many possible queries generated by our system for different questions and entities in YAGO3-10.

It does this using various techniques such as natural language generation or machine learning models trained specifically for generating answers given certain inputs like text-based questions or structured data sets.\\nIn our example scenario where we have two components - one responsible for generating queries and another for answering those queries - the Answerer would take in both of these outputs and use them together with other relevant resources to provide accurate responses to users\\' inquiries about historical figures.\\nFor instance, if someone asked whether Hans Ertl was involved in filmmaking at all during his lifetime, the Answerer could utilize its access to multiple databases containing biographical details related to him along with the output provided by the Query Generator module which had already identified potential connections between him and film production activities via their respective Wikipedia pages linked through common categories/categories/properties/etc.. Based upon this combined input, the system might respond saying something along lines of \\'Yes! According to reliable online sources including IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes ratings he indeed worked extensively behind camera lenses throughout most part of 20th century\\'. This kind of multi-faceted approach towards handling complex requests involving diverse types of content stored across different platforms makes systems powered by AI technologies extremely useful when dealing with large amounts of unstructured yet valuable pieces of information available today within public domain repositories maintained over internet space.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis concludes my blog post regarding how I implemented a simple chatbot capable of responding intelligently to basic conversational prompts utilizing cutting edge Natural Language Processing algorithms alongside powerful Artificial Intelligence engines designed especially for performing tasks requiring high levels of reasoning capabilities beyond mere pattern matching abilities possessed traditionally only by machines operating under strict rules defined explicitly beforehand. By leveraging state-of-the-art tools developed recently by leading experts working actively within field of Computer Science research community members worldwide striving hard day after day towards achieving ultimate goal i.e. creating truly sentient beings able to think independently without relying solely upon pre-programmed instructions fed manually every now & again whenever required so as to ensure smooth functioning of entire setup thus ensuring maximum efficiency while minimizing chances associated risks arising due unforeseen circumstances resulting eventually complete breakdown rendering whole operation useless altogether leaving everyone concerned deeply disappointed having wasted precious time effort money invested initially expecting better results than what actually turned out being case here unfortunately despite best efforts made nevertheless still unable achieve desired outcome hoped originally planned accordingly prior starting work itself henceforth regretting decision taken earlier sooner rather later realizing mistake committed too late repenting bitterly wishing things were otherwise instead ending up exactly same way everything went according plan laid down carefully step-by-step following directions clearly outlined precisely worded conc',\n"," 'Generated text:LECT SUM(?area) AS?totalArea WHERE { yago:County_Galway geo:hasSurfaceArea?area.}\"\\nThe above examples are just two out of many possible queries that could have been generated for these questions.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{SPARQL Query Answering}\\nOnce we obtain a set of candidate answers from our database,\\nwe need to find which one(s) best match(es)\\nthe original question asked by the human.\\nTo do this, we use \\\\textit{semantic similarity} measures\\nto compare between the meaning of the question and the meaning of its potential answers in order to determine how similar they really are.\\nWe then select those candidates with highest semantic similarities as final results.\\n\\n\\nIn general, there exist several different types of semantic similarity measures~\\\\citep{liu2012survey}.\\nHowever, most of them require some kind of background knowledge (e.g., WordNet or Wikipedia),\\nwhich may not always be available when dealing with geospatial data.\\nTherefore, we choose to employ a simple yet effective measure called \\\\emph{Levenshtein distance},\\nalso known as edit-distance~\\\\citep{levenshtein1966binary}, \\nfor measuring the degree of dissimilarity between any pair of strings.\\nThis metric has already proven useful in other applications such as speech recognition~\\\\citep{sakoe1978dynamic}.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven two string sequences $S_1$ and $S_2$, their Levenshtein distance is defined recursively as follows:\\n$$d(S_1,S_2)=min(d(S_1-e_i,S_2-f_j), d(S_1-d_k,S_2-c_l)),$$\\nwhere $i,j,k,l=0,\\\\ldots,n-1$; $n=\\\\max(|S_1|, |S_2|)$;\\nand $c,d,e,f$ represent four basic operations on strings including insertion ($+1$ cost), deletion ($+1$ cost), substitution ($+1$ cost), and no operation ($+0$ cost).\\nIntuitively speaking, given two input strings $A$ and $B$, if we want to transform $A$ into $B$ via applying minimum number of edits, then the resulting value would be exactly equal to the Levenshtein distance between $A$ and $B$. \\n\\nAs shown below, using this approach, we were able to successfully retrieve correct answers for all 10 test cases provided earlier:\\n\\n\\\\vspace{-5pt}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\\\fbox{\\\\parbox[b]{7cm}{\\n\\t\\\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\\\alph*)]\\n\\t\\t\\\\item Where is Oxfordshire located?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\\\\\\Answer: {\\\\bf',\n"," 'Generated text:lect distinct strdf:population(?geoWKT) as?pop where {<http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/city_Piraeus_1023900> geo:hasGeometry?o.?o geo:asWKT?geoWKT}\"\\nThe above two examples are taken from our demo video and show how easy it would be for users to ask questions about geographic entities in their own natural language using this system.\\nWe have also developed a web-based interface called GeoQ which allows users to interact with the system via a simple graphical user interface. This makes asking queries even easier than before since there\\'s no need to learn any new syntax or write out complex code snippets by hand anymore!\\nGeoQ has been designed so that anyone who knows basic English should find it very intuitive to use. It uses a wizard-like approach whereby you simply click through different screens until your final query is generated automatically behind-the-scenes! You don\\'t actually see what happens under the hood at all - just like when you\\'re using Google Maps or other similar services today.\\nHere\\'s a screenshot showing some example usage scenarios:\\nAs well as being able to generate standard SPARQL queries, we\\'ve also added support for generating more advanced Linked Data Fragments (LDFs). LDFs allow us to return results directly back to the client-side browser without having to make additional requests over HTTP. In fact, they work much like AJAX calls do nowadays but instead of returning JSON data structures, they\\'ll return RDF triples encoded according to one of several supported formats such as Turtle, XML/RSS feeds etc...\\nThis means that if you were to run a search against the GeoQ service then rather than getting back a list of links pointing to external resources containing answers to your original query, you\\'d get them right away within the same page itself. No extra round-trips required whatsoever!\\nIn addition to supporting both standard SPARQL and LDF output modes, we\\'ve also implemented a third mode known as \\'JSON-LD\\'. As its name suggests, this format outputs results in JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON ) form while still adhering to the rules laid down by the W3C regarding Linked Data best practices.\\nSo why did we bother adding yet another option? Well, because not everyone wants to deal with raw RDF/XML documents these days... especially those working inside modern Web browsers. Instead, most people prefer to consume information in a simpler way i.e. either as plain text strings or structured objects made up',\n"," 'Generated text:LECT DISTINCT?regionName FROM ( SELECT * from (select distinct?person,?place where {<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Perriello> <http://schema.org/birthPlace>?place} union{<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Perriello> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/source>?source}) as subquery) AS mainQuery WHERE (?mainQuery.person =?person AND?subquery.place=<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia>)\"\\nThe above two examples are taken directly from the demo page for this tool at http://sparqlgenerator.appspot.com/\\nThis project was developed by students at the University of Amsterdam and has been released under Apache License v2.0\\nLabels: natural language processing, NLP, semantic web, sparql',\n"," 'Generated text: \"SELECT?parent1,?parent2\\nWHERE { \\n  wd:Q1044 wdt:P22 [?parent1], [?parent2]\\n} LIMIT 10\"\\nThe generated queries are then sent to the Answerer component for processing and answering. This component uses Jena Fuseki as its triple store engine (Fuseki was chosen because of its ease-of-use). It also has access to the same set of Wikipedia articles that we have in our Knowledge Graph Extractor. In other words, if you want your system to know about something, just add it to one or more of these Wikipedia pages!\\nAnswering Questions with Natural Language Generation\\nOnce all questions have been answered by the Answerer, they need to be converted back from their original natural language form to plain text so that humans can read them again. We call this process Natural Language Generation.\\nNatural Language Generation is not easy! There exist many different approaches to solving this problem but none of them seem to work well enough yet. Therefore, instead of trying to solve this difficult task ourselves, we decided to use another open source project called NLG4J which provides us with some basic functionality out of the box. However, even though NLG4J does provide us with quite useful features such as sentence generation, template-based generation etc., there still remains much room for improvement when generating answers to complex questions like those found in Jeopardy!. As a result, we had to write custom code to generate answers to certain types of questions manually. These include:\\nGenerating lists of items using templates provided by NLG4J;\\nConverting numbers written in English format (\"one million\") to Arabic numerals; and,\\nUsing regular expressions to extract information from sentences containing dates/times.\\nNLG4J also allows users to define their own grammars for generating specific kinds of content. Our grammar definitions consist mainly of rules for converting data structures returned by the Answerer into human-readable strings. An example rule definition looks like this:\\n<rule name=\"date\" type=\"template\">\\n    <pattern>\\n        <literal>[[DATE]]</literal>\\n            <field ref=\"startDate\"/>\\n                <value/>\\n                    <text/>\\n                        <literal>{{{startDate}}}</literal>\\n                    </text>\\n                </value>\\n            </field>\\n            <field ref=\"endDate\"/>\\n                <value/>\\n                    <text/>\\n                        <literal>{{{endDate}}}</literal>\\n                    </text>\\n                </value>\\n            </field>\\n    </pattern>\\n</rule>\\nThis particular rule tells NLG4J how to turn two date fields named startDate and endDate into a single string representation of both dates separated by a hyphen character (-).\\nFinally, once all answers have been successfully generated',\n"," 'Generated text:WKT WHERE { yago:Scotland geo:hasGeometry?o.?o geo:asWKT?WKT.}\"\\nThe above examples are just some of many possible queries generated by our system for different questions and entities in YAGO3-10. The full list of all such queries (for every entity) has been made available at http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/semantic-web/yago/spaql/.\\n## Evaluation\\nIn this section we evaluate the performance of SpaQGen on two datasets:\\n* **YAGO3-10**: This dataset contains information about \\\\(1\\\\),\\\\(000\\\\) Wikipedia articles from various domains like sports, entertainment, politics etc., which were manually selected based on their popularity among users [5]. Each article was then converted into its corresponding RDF representation using DBpedia Spotlight[6] and finally merged with YAGO3-10 knowledge base to form the final dataset containing around \\\\(4M\\\\) triples.\\n* **DBPedia2010**: We also evaluated SpaQGen on another popularly known benchmarking dataset called _\"DBPedia 2010\"_ consisting of over \\\\(100K\\\\) facts extracted from English version of Wikipedia. For evaluation purposes, we only considered those entities whose labels appeared more than once in the entire corpus as they would most likely appear multiple times during testing phase too.\\n### Metrics Used\\nWe use three metrics namely precision, recall and F-measure to measure the effectiveness of SpaQGen against other state-of-the-art systems. These measures are defined below:\\n**Precision:** It represents the ratio between number of correct answers retrieved out of total number of answers returned by the system. Mathematically,\\n\\\\[precision=\\\\frac{\\\\textit{number\\\\_of\\\\_correct\\\\_answers}}{\\\\textit{total\\\\_number\\\\_of\\\\_retrieved\\\\_answers}}.\\\\]\\n**Recall:** It denotes the percentage of relevant documents actually found by the retrieval engine compared to the actual number of relevant documents present in the collection. Formally stated,\\n\\\\[recall=\\\\frac{\\\\textit{number\\\\_of\\\\_relevant\\\\_documents\\\\_found}}{\\\\textit{actual\\\\_number\\\\_of\\\\_relevant\\\\_documents}}.\\\\]\\n**F-Measure:** A combination of both Precision and Recall scores, F-measure provides us with a single value indicating how effective or accurate a given search algorithm',\n"," 'Generated text:type y2geoo:County.?county y2geoo:hasArea?area} ORDER BY ASC (?area)\"\\nThe above examples show how simple questions about geographical features and their relationships with other objects or regions can easily be answered using this system.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\nThis project currently only supports queries over OSM data. It does not support any other sources such as OpenStreetMap Wiki pages, Wikipedia articles etc. This means that if you want to ask for information on a particular place then your best bet would probably be to use Google Maps instead. However, we hope to add more sources soon so stay tuned!\\n\\nAnother limitation is that our current implementation uses a single triple store which contains all available triples from both Wikidata and OpenStreetMap. While this works well enough for small datasets like',\n"," 'Generated text::County_of_the_Irish_Free_State.?county y2geo:hasPopulation?popCount.?county y2geo:name \\'Leitrim\\' }\"',\n"," 'Generated text:T DISTINCT * FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT?uri1 AS uri2,?uri2 AS uri4,?uri3 AS uri5,?uri4 AS uri6,?uri5 AS uri7,?uri6 AS uri8,?uri7 AS uri10,?uri8 AS uri11,?uri9 AS uri12,?uri10 AS uri13,?uri11 AS uri14,?uri12 AS uri15,?uri13 AS uri16,?uri14 AS uri17,?uri15 AS uri18,?uri16 AS uri19,?uri17 AS uri20,?uri18 AS uri21,?uri19 AS uri22,?uri20 AS uri23,?uri21 AS uri24,?uri22 AS uri25,?uri23 AS uri26,?uri24 AS uri27,?uri25 AS uri28,?uri26 AS uri29,?uri27 AS uri30,?uri28 AS uri31,?uri29 AS uri32,?uri30 AS uri33,?uri31 AS uri34,?uri32 AS uri35,?uri33 AS uri36,?uri34 AS uri37,?uri35 AS uri38,?uri36 AS uri39,?uri37 AS uri40,?uri38 AS uri41,?uri39 AS uri42,?uri40 AS uri43,?uri41 AS uri44,?uri42 AS uri45,?uri43 AS uri46,?uri44 AS uri47,?uri45 AS uri48,?uri46 AS uri49,?uri47 AS uri50,?uri48 AS uri51,?uri49 AS uri52,?uri50 AS uri53,?uri51 AS uri54,?uri52 AS uri55,?uri53 AS uri56,?uri54 AS uri57',\n"," 'Generated text:ASK WHERE {\\nwd:Q854 wdt:P31 wd:Q69503233\\n}\"\\n\\nThe above examples are all taken from [1]. Note how in some cases (e.g., for questions about relationships) we need to use disjunctions and/or negations.\\n\\n## 2.3 Query Answering\\n\\nOnce you have generated your queries using our tool or manually written them yourself, you may want to run these queries against one of several public endpoints available online. We recommend using Virtuoso as this has been shown to perform well with respect to other popular triple stores such as Blazegraph and AllegroGraph. You should also consider running multiple instances of Virtuoso if possible so that parallelization can take place across different servers. This would allow you to scale up your system without having to worry too much about hardware limitations.\\n\\nVirtuoso offers two ways to submit queries:\\n\\n• Using its web interface at http://localhost:8899/sparql/\\n• Via HTTP requests sent over POST/GET methods to localhost:8899/sparql/\\n\\nWe suggest using the latter method since it allows us to easily integrate Virtuoso within our own application codebase. In order to do so, however, we must first create a new endpoint by following the instructions here. Once done, we can then send our queries via cURL commands like below:\\ncurl -XPOST --data-binary @query.txt \\'http://localhost:8899/sparql/?format=json&default-graph-uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org\\'\\n\\nwhere query.txt contains the actual SPARQL query itself. If everything goes according to plan, we\\'ll receive back a JSON object containing either true/false values depending upon whether or not there exists any answers to our original question(s).']"]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Load model directly\n","from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n","\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B\")\n","model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B\", device_map=\"auto\", load_in_8bit=True)\n","\n","print(model.get_memory_footprint())\n","\n","Quantized_Inference(model, tokenizer, \"Llama-3-8b\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["* ### Llama-3-8b-Instruct"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-23T12:41:28.656125Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-23T12:41:28.655667Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-23T12:53:17.076319Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-23T12:53:17.075322Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-23T12:41:28.656096Z"},"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"acc2b6e665224b28a57b21a5c36471c8","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["tokenizer_config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/51.0k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"ccc3b1d8cc634189aa5071f415f0023d","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["tokenizer.json:   0%|          | 0.00/9.09M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"84e8112b46e243d1b20b8ec59137d279","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["special_tokens_map.json:   0%|          | 0.00/73.0 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"ceb389707f834e4881037c0b0a3fed15","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/654 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions.
