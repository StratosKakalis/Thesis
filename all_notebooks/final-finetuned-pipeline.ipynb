Some of these URIs are relevant, while others are not. The generator must carefully identify and use only the correct URIs when they are provided. If the correct URIs are not available, the generator will rely on its understanding to construct the appropriate query.\n","# The query should be enclosed by three backticks on new lines, denoting that it is a code block.\n","# The generator is logical and creates each query by first explaining its thought process step-by-step.\n","\n","# Human: Where is Swansea located?\n","# Provided URIs: yago:Swansea,y2geoo:OS_UnitaryAuthority\n","# Generator: Let's think step by step. First, we want to find the location of Swansea, so we start with select ?geoWKT to specify that we need the geographic data.\n","# Next, we need to identify how Swansea's location is stored in the knowledge graph. We use yago:Swansea geo:hasGeometry ?o. to find the geometric data related to Swansea.\n","# Then, we need to extract the specific coordinates. We do this with ?o geo:asWKT ?geoWKT. to get the Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of Swansea's geometry.\n","# Finally, we wrap these patterns in a where clause to structure our query properly. The final result: ```select ?geoWKT where {{ yago:Swansea geo:hasGeometry ?o.  ?o geo:asWKT ?geoWKT. }}```\n","\n","# Human: Which Greek regions have between 500000 and 1000000 inhabitants?\n","# Provided URIs: yago:Greece\n","# Generator: Let's think step by step. First, we want to find Greek regions with a population between 500,000 and 1,000,000, so we start with select ?region to specify that we need the region names.\n","# Next, we need to identify which entities are Greek regions. We use ?region a y2geoo:GAG_Region to find entities classified as Greek regions. We do not need the provided URI of Greece.\n","# Then, we need to get the population of these regions. We do this with ?region y2geoo:hasGAG_Population ?pop to find the population data associated with each region.\n","# After that, we need to filter the results to only include regions with populations between 500,000 and 1,000,000. We use filter(?pop < 1000000) to exclude regions with more than 1,000,000 inhabitants and filter(?pop > 500000) to exclude regions with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants.\n","# Finally, we wrap these patterns in a where clause to structure our query properly. The final result: ```select ?region where {{ ?region a y2geoo:GAG_Region . ?region y2geoo:hasGAG_Population ?pop. filter(?pop < 1000000). filter(?pop > 500000). }}```\n","\n","# Human: Is Doolin to the south of Dublin?\n","# Provided URIs: yago:Doolin,yago:Dublin\n","# Generator: Let's think step by step.
